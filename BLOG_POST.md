# Modeling React State as a Finite State Machine

*A modern approach using TypeScript discriminated unions and hooks*

---

In [Building a Traffic Light React App](https://johntcosta.hashnode.dev/building-a-traffic-light-react-app), I explored how naming states by their **business meaning** rather than their visual representation makes state machines more maintainable. Instead of `red-light-green-arrow`, we used `PriorityStraight` — a domain concept that scales as complexity grows.

This post takes those same ideas and applies them to a common React pattern: managing complex UI state with hooks.

## The Problem: Boolean Soup

Here's a typical React component managing a blog post editor:

```typescript
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
const [isSaving, setIsSaving] = useState(false);
const [isPublishing, setIsPublishing] = useState(false);
const [hasError, setHasError] = useState(false);
const [errorMessage, setErrorMessage] = useState('');
const [showPublishModal, setShowPublishModal] = useState(false);
const [showDiscardModal, setShowDiscardModal] = useState(false);
const [showSuccessMessage, setShowSuccessMessage] = useState(false);
const [isDirty, setIsDirty] = useState(false);
```

Nine `useState` calls. Nine independent booleans.

**Here's the problem:** With 9 booleans, there are 2⁹ = **512 possible combinations**. But how many are actually valid UI states? Maybe 9 or 10.

That means **~97% of possible states are invalid**. Can both modals be open? Can we be saving AND publishing? The type system allows it. Your UI doesn't. This gap is where bugs live.

## The Solution: One State to Rule Them All

What are the actual states our editor can be in?

```typescript
type EditorState =
  | { kind: 'editing'; draft: PostData; original: PostData }
  | { kind: 'saving-draft'; draft: PostData; original: PostData }
  | { kind: 'draft-saved'; draft: SavedPostData; original: PostData }
  | { kind: 'save-error'; draft: PostData; original: PostData; error: string }
  | { kind: 'confirming-publish'; draft: PostData; original: PostData }
  | { kind: 'publishing'; draft: PostData; original: PostData }
  | { kind: 'publish-error'; draft: PostData; original: PostData; error: string }
  | { kind: 'confirming-discard'; draft: PostData; original: PostData }
  | { kind: 'published'; post: SavedPostData };
```

Nine explicit states. One `useState` call:

```typescript
const [state, setState] = useState<EditorState>({
  kind: 'editing',
  draft: { title: '', content: '' },
  original: { title: '', content: '' },
});
```

## Why This Works

### 1. Impossible States Are Impossible

With boolean soup, nothing prevents `showPublishModal` and `showDiscardModal` from both being `true`. With a discriminated union, you can only be in ONE state at a time. The type system enforces it.

### 2. Domain-Driven State Names

Just like naming traffic light states `PriorityStraight` instead of `red-light-green-arrow`, we name our states by what they **mean**, not what they **look like**:

- `'saving-draft'` — not `isSaving && !isPublishing && !showModal`
- `'confirming-publish'` — not `showPublishModal && !showDiscardModal`

When you read `state.kind === 'confirming-discard'`, you know exactly what's happening.

### 3. Each State Carries Its Context

Notice how `save-error` includes an `error` property, but `editing` doesn't? Each state carries only the data it needs. No stale `errorMessage` hanging around from a previous failed save.

### 4. Exhaustive Switch Statements

TypeScript's exhaustive checking ensures you handle every state:

```typescript
const assertNever = (x: never): never => {
  throw new Error(`Unexpected state: ${x}`);
};

switch (state.kind) {
  case 'editing':
    // ...
  case 'saving-draft':
    // ...
  // If you forget a case, TypeScript errors!
  default:
    return assertNever(state);
}
```

Add a new state to the union? TypeScript shows errors everywhere you forgot to handle it.

### 5. Explicit Transitions

State transitions become clear, intentional functions:

```typescript
const openPublishConfirmation = () => {
  switch (state.kind) {
    case 'editing':
    case 'draft-saved':
      setState({
        kind: 'confirming-publish',
        draft: state.draft,
        original: state.original,
      });
      return;

    // All other states: can't open publish modal
    case 'saving-draft':
    case 'publishing':
    // ...
      return;

    default:
      assertNever(state);
  }
};
```

You can see exactly which states allow transitioning to `confirming-publish`. This is your state machine, defined in code.

## Try It Yourself

I've built a live demo with both approaches side-by-side:

**[View Demo →](https://costajohnt.github.io/state-machine-blog-post/)**

**[View Source →](https://github.com/costajohnt/state-machine-blog-post)**

Interact with both editors. Notice how the "After" version displays its current state — you always know exactly what's happening.

## When To Use This Pattern

This pattern shines when:

- You have **3+ boolean states** that interact
- States are **mutually exclusive** (one modal at a time, one async operation)
- You're tracking **loading/success/error cycles**
- You find yourself writing conditions like `if (!isLoading && !isSaving && !hasError)`

For a single `isOpen` boolean? Overkill. For anything resembling "boolean soup"? Worth it.

## What About XState?

[XState](https://xstate.js.org/) is excellent for complex state machines with visualization tools and formal semantics. But this pattern requires:

- Zero dependencies
- Just TypeScript + `useState`
- Knowledge you already have

Start here. Graduate to XState when you need it.

## Conclusion

The next time you reach for a fourth `useState<boolean>`, stop and ask: **what are the actual states my UI can be in?**

Model those states explicitly. Name them by their domain meaning. Let TypeScript enforce that impossible states are impossible.
